# Simple Interest Calculator

Welcome to the Simple Interest Calculator project! This repository hosts a simple script to calculate simple interest, aimed at empowering low-income individuals through financial literacy. This is the first step in transitioning our codebase from Subversion (SVN) to Git, promoting collaboration and community involvement.

## Mission

Our mission at our Micro-Finance Startup is to empower low-income individuals by providing them with the tools and knowledge to make informed financial decisions. This project is part of our effort to share resources and support our community.

## Features

- Calculate simple interest using the formula:  
  \[ \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]  
  where:
  - **P** = Principal amount
  - **R** = Rate of interest (per annum)
  - **T** = Time (in years)

- Clear and easy-to-use script to facilitate understanding of interest calculations.
